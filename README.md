# TOONSsEEG_QI
This repository is intended as a public record of our rationale and plans for data collection, analysis, and visualisation in relation to a quality initiative evaluating patient experience of sEEG electrical stimulation mapping.

This R script is meant to document our rationale and plans for data collection, analysis, and visualisation. Page numbers, "R code" headers, and some text excerpts borrow heavily from -- and with sincere appreciation for -- Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking (2nd Edition) and the accompanying code file. These are included to illustrate and provide context to our plans, expectations, and interpretations. In no way do we intend to portray excerpted content as our own original intellectual property.

This script is intended as a record of our thinking at the time of creation and upload. It will further serve as a useful benchmark against which we can gauge the evolution of our understanding and approach to these clinical issues.

Finally, all data included in public repositories are simulated (i.e. no data from actual persons is included).
